# NES Emulator

A simple NES Emulator made just for fun using SDL2.

It _should_ be compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux but I've tested it only on Linux.

This is heavily inspired from [https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

## Building

To build this project you'll need CMake, a C++17 compiler and SDL2 installed on your system.

Build with:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
